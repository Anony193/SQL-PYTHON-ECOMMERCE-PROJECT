2. **Open Command Line/Terminal**  
   Launch your command line interface (cmd on Windows, Terminal on macOS and Linux).

3. **Navigate to the Project Directory**  
   Change the directory to where your project files are located. For example:
   ```bash
   cd path\to\your\downloaded\folder
   ```

4. **Run the Main Script**  
   Start the application by running:
   ```bash
   python main_script.py
   ```
   Replace `main_script.py` with the actual name of the main script file included in your downloads.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

This application processes and visualizes the eCommerce dataset effectively. Here are some key features:
